# 🏅 Olympic Medal Predictor - Machine Learning Model

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **Medal Prediction Model** that uses **Linear Regression** to predict the number of medals a country might win based on historical Olympic data. The dataset includes various features like the number of athletes, age, previous medals, and more.

## 🚀 What I Learned  
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:  
✔️ **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, type conversions, and feature selection.  
✔️ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding data patterns using Pandas and correlation analysis.  
✔️ **Feature Engineering** – Selecting key attributes affecting medal counts.  
✔️ **Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn)** – Implementing and evaluating a **Linear Regression Model**.  
✔️ **Model Performance Metrics** – Checking accuracy with **R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of historical Olympic participation data with the following key features:  
- `team` - The country name  
- `year` - The Olympic year  
- `athletes` - Number of participating athletes  
- `age` - Average age of the athletes  
- `prev_medals` - Medals won in the previous Olympics  
- `medals` - Actual medals won (Target Variable)
